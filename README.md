a repository for my Pi5 laptop. 
This repository is just a holding place for design files at the moment.  

I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING IT AT THIS TIME!!! I made a lot of specific design choices that I don't care to explain right now, and the FreeCAD files are a bit of a mess. (and Im a novice for sure with freeCAD). And to add to that it's not complete. There is no top palmrest, any mounting points for the screen, nor a front bezel. Also the mounting points for the trackball interfere with installing the PI5. The PI exit ports for USB2, USB3 and ethernet do not quite line up right. All and all, you've been warned :) 

Parts:



1. Pi5 8GB, and Pi5 official cooler
2. Waveshare UPS - https://www.waveshare.com/ups-hat.htm

5. 2x5000mAh Lipo (remove protection boards) - https://a.co/d/iKhJBcd

8. 10.5 1920x1280 LCD Monitor - https://a.co/d/gWEaZZS
        this monitor I needed to un-case to make it thinner and I broke it as it is extremely fragile. So Im using the board, and ordered just the panel which is:
        NV105WAM-N31 10.5‚Äù 1920X1280 - Same screen as a Surface Go 3 but without the touchscreen.
