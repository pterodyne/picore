a repository for my Pi5 laptop. 
This repository is just a holding place for design files at the moment.  

I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING IT AT THIS TIME!!! I made a lot of specific design choices that I don't care to explain right now, and the FreeCAD files are a bit of a mess. (and Im a novice for sure with freeCAD). And to add to that it's not complete. There is no top palmrest, any mounting points for the screen, nor a front bezel. Also the mounting points for the trackball interfere with installing the PI5. The PI exit ports for USB2, USB3 and ethernet do not quite line up right. All and all, you've been warned :)
