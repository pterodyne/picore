a repository for my Pi5 laptop. 
This repository is just a holding place for design files at the moment.  

I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING IT AT THIS TIME!!! I made a lot of specific design choices that I don't care to explain right now, and the FreeCAD files are a bit of a mess. (and Im a novice for sure with freeCAD). And to add to that it's not complete. There is no top palmrest, any mounting points for the screen, nor a front bezel. Also the mounting points for the trackball interfere with installing the PI5. The PI exit ports for USB2, USB3 and ethernet do not quite line up right. All and all, you've been warned :) 

Parts:



1. Pi5 8GB, and Pi5 official cooler
2. Waveshare UPS - https://www.waveshare.com/product/ups-hat-d.htm
        Desolder pogo pins and make harness to go to GPIO for +5, G and 2xI2c.
        Desolder the USB A connector, and power switch (solder bridged to on).
        Desolder battery holders
3. USB 2.0 Hub board - https://a.co/d/d6xFPpz
4. USB C PD Trigger Board - https://a.co/d/i6ZYw3r
5. 2x5000mAh Lipo (remove protection boards) - https://a.co/d/iKhJBcd
6. MNT Reform Trackball - https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform-optical-trackball-module
7. Vortex Core Keyboard - https://vortexgear.store/products/core
8. 10.5 1920x1280 LCD Monitor - https://a.co/d/gWEaZZS
        this monitor I needed to un-case to make it thinner and I broke it as it is extremely fragile. So Im using the board, and ordered just the panel which is:
        NV105WAM-N31 10.5‚Äù 1920X1280 - Same screen as a Surface Go 3 but without the touchscreen.
9. USB C 2.0 Solder connectors - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091CRLJM2?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_2WHZ4DZWF5TPE4Q6B9QM
10. Micro USB Solder connectors - https://a.co/d/3a1dL1D  for the keyboard
11. Random hookup wire for USB leads, power leads etc.
12. HDMI Cables.  Still working this out, trying ribbon cables.  It remains to be seen if 1920x1280 will work on a ribbon cable.  Plan B is to strip the plastic off the connectors to make them as small as possible.  Mini HDMI to Micro required for monitor and Pi5.  Maybe a better monitor could be found, but I wanted the 1920x1280 resolution and I could only find that in HDMI.  DSI seemed to max out at 1280x800 and didn't work at the ribbon cable length needed.
